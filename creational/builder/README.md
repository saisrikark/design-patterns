# builder

<p>
Builder pattern is used during the creation of complex objects. <br />
These objects might require extensive configuration. <br />
Example: A house may be built in very different ways. <br />
Some would like a flat roof, other's a sloped and tiled roof. <br />
Some would like a lawn, other's stone. <br />
In such ways, some parameters might even be omitted. <br />

Director is another pattern that builds on top of this and and even further simplifies the building process by giving the ability to select pre defined builds. <br />
To put it simply, the director knows which steps to execute to get a specified result from the builder.
Example: Someone might want a Kerala styled house.
