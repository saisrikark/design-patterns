A factory design pattern is used in object creation.
It helps in determining which kind of object is to be created.
There are four elements to this pattern.

1. Factory provides the signature to create a factory
2. Conrete Factory is the implementation of a factory
3. Product is the signature of the object
4. Concrete Product is the implementation of the product
