# proxy

<p> 
Client asks for an object. <br/>
Instead of sending a real object the proxy is sent. <br/>
Caching is an example. <br/>
HTTP proxy is another example. <br/>
It is used in preprocessing and postprocessing. <br/>
Proxy manages the life cycle of the underlying objects on it's own. <br/>
Whereas decorator offloads this to the client.
